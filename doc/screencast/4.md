# Ideas

  - Use [luminus](http://www.luminusweb.net/) to create a simple web app
  - Maybe use [clj-http-fake](https://github.com/myfreeweb/clj-http-fake) instead of a real web app
  - Use [dakrone's clj-http](https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http) to test it on the client-side
  - Features to test
    * Simple get
    * Get Json
    * Post a form
    * Cookies
    * Status code
    * Redirect
    * Basic auth
    * Query params
    * Create a request object by hand
  - Server-side features
    * Java interop
    * Logging
    * ClojureScript
